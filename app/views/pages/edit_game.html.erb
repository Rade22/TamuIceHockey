			Once on the Games page, you will first need to navigate to the game you want to edit. After 
			finding the desired game, you must press the blue "Edit Game" button.
			</p>
			
			<%= image_tag("edit_game.png", size:"500x250") %>
			
			<p>
			This button will take you to the edit game page where you will find all of the game information 
			you filled out when you created the game as well as some new fields related to statistics. Once
			you are satisfied with the changes, click the green button at the bottom of the page called 
			"Update Game".
			</p>
			
			<%= image_tag("update_game.png", size:"500x250") %>
			
			<p>
			Once updated, you will be taken back to the Games page where you can, once again, navigate to the
			game to confirm the changes. It is also worth noting that if you entered the stats for that game, you 
			may have notice that color of the game card on the Games page might have changed. This is because the 
			the card will card will change color based on the outcome of the game. A victory will have result in a 
			green card and a loss will result in a red card. This is demonstrated in the example below.
