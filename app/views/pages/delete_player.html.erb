			<h2>Delete Players:</h2>
			<p>
			In order to delete a player, you will first need to be on the Players page like the one seen
			in the image below. Then you will need to navigate to the player profile you are wanting to 
			delete. Once you have found the player, you will want to press the blue button labeled 
			"Edit Profile".
			</p>
			
			<%= image_tag("edit_player.png", size:"500x250") %>
			
			<p>
			You should be to the edit profile page for this specific player. In order to delete this player,
			you must press the red "Delete Player" button at the bottom of the page.
			</p>
			
			<%= image_tag("delete1_player.png", size:"500x250") %>
			
			<p>
			You should be directed to the confirmation page seen below. You must, once again, press the red
			"Delete Player" button.
			</p>
			
			<%= image_tag("delete2_player.png", size:"500x250") %>
			
			<p>
			This will display a final confirmation message in the center of your screen
			like the one in the image below. This will be you last chance before the player is completely 
			deleted from the website. If you are still sure you want to delete this player, then click the
			"OK" option on the confirmation box. You will be directed back to the Games page where the old,
			deleted player should be gone.
